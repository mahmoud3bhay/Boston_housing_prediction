# Boston_housing_prediction
 i have created boston price prediction project using 6 different machine learning algorithms .
 
The Boston Price Prediction Project is a machine learning project that aimed to predict the prices of houses in Boston.
The project utilized various techniques such as exploratory data analysis , before training  different machine learning models.
These models included linear regression,ridge regression , lasso regression , xgboost regressor, KNN regressor, decision tree regressor, random forest, XGBoost, and SVR.
The performance of each model was evaluated using RMSE and R-squared metrics, and XGBoost was chosen for deployment due to its accuracy of 89%.
